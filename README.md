# my-currency-converter
This is a currency converter built with vanilla Javascript to work as a progressive web app which retrieves it's currency list from the <a href ="https://free.currencyconverterapi.com/">The Free Currency Converter API</a>.

It is built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript as well as BootStrap for Responsiveness.

It retrieves the currency list from the API and stores them in an indexDB object store and when the user goes offline, it uses the values from the indexDB to perform conversions.
